(Paper in preparation)
Our study focused on the high resolution of pneumatic myography with passive elastic elements in the human body. We achieved 97.5% accuracy in the classification of 28 gestures. The baseline SOTA method with 8-channel sEMG (Delsys, USA) achieved 94% accuracy.
The experiment involved 10 subjects. Details will be released later.

### [Dynamic gesture recognition](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)

(Paper in preparation)
Studies on gesture recognition are often not focused on real-world applications. We studied the critical factors in gesture recognition in the presence of dynamic arm movements. Based on the analysis, we suggested sensor placement, training method, and classification algorithm for real-world applications.
Details will be released later.

(Under progress)
Prevailing gait analysis methodoligy utilizes IMUs or encoders. However, those sensor system requires solid brackets and misalignment problems are often caused. We developed a soft sensor system with ergonomic design and optimizing our algorithm for the robust real-time gait phase & mode analysis.

(Paper in preparation)
<br>
Our study focused on the high resolution of pneumatic myography with passive elastic elements in the human body. We achieved 97.5% accuracy in the classification of 28 gestures. The baseline SOTA method with 8-channel sEMG (Delsys, USA) achieved 94% accuracy. (The experiment involved 10 subjects.)

Details will be released later.

(Paper in preparation)
<br>
Studies on gesture recognition are often not focused on real-world applications. We studied the critical factors in gesture recognition in the presence of dynamic arm movements. Based on the analysis, we suggested sensor placement, training method, and classification algorithm for real-world applications.
<br>
Details will be released later.

(Under progress)
<br>
Most gait analysis methods employ IMUs or encoders. However, those sensor system requires solid brackets, and misalignment problems are often caused. We developed a soft sensor system with an ergonomic design and optimized our algorithm for the robust real-time gait phase & mode analysis.

- A very early step of this study was announced in [ICCAS 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9649762)

## Reinforcement Learning

### <mark style='background-color: #f1f8ff'>Style transfer of human to a robot with limited DOFs</mark>
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="wcGt7EAkdVg" %}
(Under progress)
<br>
Natural-looking joint trajectory generation is essential for wearable robots. At the same time, the system must consider the wearer's safety and reasonable energy consumption. This study aims to transfer the walking style of the human being to a robot with limited DOFs based on the [Adversarial Motion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02180), which is an adverarial imitation learning based on unorganized motion dataset.
